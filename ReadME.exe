# Algorithmic Trading Project

## Overview

This project is an algorithmic trading system designed to analyze market data, generate trading signals, and execute trades based on predefined strategies. The system utilizes historical market data to train machine learning models that predict future price movements, allowing for informed trading decisions.

- **Data Retrieval**: The project includes functions to load historical market data from CSV files, which contain OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for various financial instruments.
- **Technical Indicators**: Implementation of various technical indicators, including Simple Moving Averages (SMA), to analyze price trends and generate signals.
- **Timeframe Management**: Support for multiple timeframes (e.g., M1, H1, D1) to cater to different trading strategies and preferences.
- **Classification System**: A classification system that categorizes future price movements based on expected changes and historical patterns.
- **Image Generation**: Visualization of trading signals and historical price data through generated images, aiding in model training and testing.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging to ensure smooth execution and debugging of the trading system.
- **Directory Management**: Automatic creation of necessary directories for storing datasets, models, and outputs.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `Pillow`
  - `math`
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas Pillow


Usage:
>Data Preparation: Place your historical market data CSV files in the csv directory. Ensure the filenames follow the convention {ticker}_{timeframe}.csv.

>Configuration: Modify the parameters in the code, such as the ticker symbol, timeframes, and SMA periods as needed.

>Run the Project: Execute the main script to start the data processing and trading signal generation.

>Output: Generated images and trading signals will be saved in the appropriate directories for further analysis.
